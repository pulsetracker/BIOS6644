    "# Normalization\n",
    "For my project, I wanted to build a pipeline that would allow me to easily apply some of my most commonly used normalization techniques sequentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo I apply the following normalizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LongToWideFormat** - This converts the \"long\" format data (each row is a measurement) to a \"wide\" format (each row contains all measurements for a single subject).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TimeSeriesResampler** - By default, the PAXRAW dataset reports cumulative activity over each minute of the study week. This is usually too noisy to use on its own, so I resample it to a lower frequency (5mins, 15mins, etc). to clean up some of the noise. In this case, I have Pandas resample the data to a 5-minute interval by summing up the 1-minute measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NaNReplacer** - Depending on the dataset and timestamp type used, some subjects could end up with NaN measurments (if the device did not record any measurements for one portion of the study, etc). If the NaNs are infrequent, I usually just replace them with 0. Right now, this method just sets all NaN values to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ConstValueDropper** - One issue that occurs in the PAXRAW dataset is the inclusion of measurements which have a constant value for the entire study period, which can lead to interesting results if you try to cluster the data. I'm not sure if this is caused by a device malfunction or something else, but these values are obviously incorrect. This module will drop any rows (subjects) which have a constant value for all measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **StableSeasonalFilter** - This module allows me to correct the data for the \"seasonal\" diurnal patterns that occur by having a user wear the device over a week-long study. When clustering the data, the \"strongest\" signal is often a sinusoidal pattern with 7 peaks (i.e. higher activity during waking hours, low/no activity at night). We are interested in more subtle patterns though, so this module allows us to correct the data by removing this seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **ZTransformNormalize** - This module normalizes the measurements for each subject (row) to have $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma=1$. This preserves the overall shape of the series, but normalizes it to account for different activity levels in each patient."
